## Definitions

### Player Creature

A player creature is both a player and a creature.

### Wounded

A wounded player creature is one that no longer benefits from its toughness, and instead loses life whenever it takes damage.

### Roll

A roll is the numerical result of rolling 2d6. A stat roll is an ordinary roll plus the value of the named stat. (For example, a speed roll is 2d6 + speed.)

### Channeling Action

A channeling action is any of the following:

* casting a spell
* activating an activated ability of a non-land non-player permanent (Activated abilities on player creatures do not count as channeling actions.)

### Swift Strike X

Whenever combat damage would be dealt, creatures with the highest swift strike X deal their damage first, then creatures with the next-highest, and so on. This happens during the first-strike combat step and during the regular combat damage step. Between each set of swift-strike damage, creatures can die and be removed from combat, and players gain priority. (Swift Strike is like first strike, except scalable, and weaker unless combined with first strike.)

### Limited X

A limited X activated ability cannot be activated more than X times per turn.

### Identity Affinity

If your color identity matches an activated ability's identity affinity, that activated ability costs {2} less to cast or activate.
