## Universal Rules

Your memory cannot exceed 10.

Your focus cannot exceed 20.

Your minimum deck size is 40 + your level - your focus. (As you gain levels, you will be able to remove more and more lands from your library when you enter combat mode.)

Your maximum sideboard size is your Focus + your memory.

The 4-card-per-name limit is instead a 1-card-per-name limit. (Exceptions such as basic lands and Relentless Rats still are not limited.)

Your life total is persistent between combats.

When you finish a rest, your life total becomes equal to your maximum life.

When you enter encounter mode, you may search your library for a number of land cards up to to your level and put them onto the battlefield.

Your deck cannot include spells with a CMC greater than your mastery.

Your deck cannot include cards that do not match your color identity. For a spell to match your color identity, its text cannot include any colored mana symbol that does not appear in your color identity. Additionally, for each colored mana symbol in a spell's casting cost, your color identity must have a distinct mana symbol corresponding to that one. (For example, you can only include Counterspell if your color-identity contains {U}{U}. However, you can include Syncopate if your color identity contains only a single {U}. For a spell costing {G/R}, your identity would need to include either green or red.)

Whenever your level increases, gain a number of build points equal to 5 times your level. Your level cannot increase by more than one at a time, and it cannot increase while this effect is on the stack.

X build points: Choose one of your growable stats with a value of X-1. Increase the value of that stat to X. This ability can only be activated at the end of a short rest.
